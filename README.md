## Developer Notes

I've loved this series for a long time and as a audiophile I bought the blurays and extracted the soundtracks in flac lossless from them. When I was going to add them to my media server (I use Jellyfin) 
and I wanted to batch rename all of the soundtrack albums with some better metadata and thought, "Why don't I just make a program to do this instead of a terminal program just for me?"

Fast forward 6 months and now we're here in November of 2024. 

I spent a lot of time on this as I've never used PySide6 and had to learn the hard way that everything I wanted to do just wasn't possible :)

I'm aware that less than 10 people will probably ever use this and that does make me disappointed. But while making it I felt happy to contribute and make something for a series that has changed my life.
So if you are reading this, thank you. You can find me at `synthworks` on Discord and Reddit.
