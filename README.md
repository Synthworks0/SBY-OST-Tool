# SBY OST Tool

The SBY OST Tool is a powerful tool that extracts/downloads and renames soundtracks from the "Seishun Buta Yarou" (Rascal Does Not Dream) series.

* If there is translation issues please feel free to let me know! Translations are all done by me or retrieved from a music database.

* Sakuta doesn't have a album cover because no offical one was ever made

## Features

- Extract soundtracks from the SBY series
- Rename soundtrack files in multiple languages (Japanese, Romaji, English)
- In-program track playback
- Dynamic color theming based on album artwork
